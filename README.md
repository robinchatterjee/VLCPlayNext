VLC Play Next in Folder LUA modification
This is amodifcation of the VLC extension by Mindconstructor available here 
https://pastebin.com/2zukFHVF

once the extension is activated from the view menu everytime you stop playback it will start the next file in the folder. Beware this has not undergone extensive testing .
If you want to stop playback use pause and close vlc or disable the extension.
also note you cannot have "Quit at the end of playlist enabled.
this can be change by making pause the trigger to skip instead of stop.
